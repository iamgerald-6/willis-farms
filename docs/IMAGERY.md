- Composition: clean backgrounds; show systems and routines (not clutter).
- People: PPE where applicable (boots, coveralls, gloves), confident posture, professional demeanor.
- Biosecurity visuals: controlled entry points, footbaths, handwash stations, signage, record-keeping.
- Product visuals: premium pork cuts packaged for B2B supply (clean, non-graphic), cold-room/handling where appropriate.
